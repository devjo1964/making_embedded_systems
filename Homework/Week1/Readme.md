Auto-calculating Dart Board

A dart board that will automatically calculate the score based on the game mode selected.

I'm not a huge dart player or anything, but the idea stems from those "smart" dart board games that you would sometimes find in a bar. These dart boards and darts are made of plastic and the board consists of hundreds of tiny holes for the dart to land in and ultimately register a throw. If you've ever played, you'll know that the dart often just hits the board and falls off; either because the dart is bent, or that the dart just didn't make a good connection with one of the tiny holes. 

Mine would consist of a real dart cork board and a real metal (and sharp) dart. Within the enclosure, there would be a micro-controller that would take in data from some sensors to indicate the position of the dart on the board. The position would translate to a score and then get calculated into a result that would appear on a screen for the players.
